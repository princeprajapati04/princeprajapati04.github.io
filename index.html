		<section id="about">
			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				I am a third-year Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Cincinnati with minors in Mathematics and Insurance and Risk Management. I am passionate about applying engineering principles to real-world challenges,
				especially in design, manufacturing, and automation. I have gained hands-on experience through internships in the medical device, construction materials, and drone technology industries. My work includes designing injector
				components and PCB enclosures using SolidWorks, developing detailed P&IDs to support process safety, and contributing to drone component designs using CAD tools. In addition to my technical experience, I have worked on
				campus as a Desk Assistant and BME student worker, where I developed strong communication, organization, and problem-solving skills. I also support student learning as a Chemistry Teaching Assistant and a math and science
				tutor. I enjoy combining creativity and technical skills to develop meaningful solutions and am always open to connecting with professionals in engineering and related fields.
